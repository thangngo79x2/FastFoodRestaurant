                        <h4>Beginning step</h4>
                        <h5>August - 2021</h5>
                        <p>

                            The story begins during the time when the Covid-19 epidemic in 2021 is happening in Vietnam, making it difficult for all students to go to school. At an online course on web programming organized by FPT University, Mr. Ngo Quang Thang shook hands with Mr. Nguyen Van Hoang to create an idea to create a private brand. But things did not go well because the two men did not come up with any ideas despite discussing for a long time.

                        </p>
                        <h5>September - 2021</h5>
                        <p>

                            Mr. Hoang suddenly came up with an idea for creating a fried chicken business when he was complaining to the staff of a fried chicken shop when the store's ordering website was too bad because he ordered a long time ago but The website did not notify his order to the store.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Mr. Hoang immediately said this idea to Mr. Thang and Mr. Thang immediately nodded in agreement. On September 15, 2021, the two men jointly established Thang Hoang Company. On September 16, 2021, Mr. Thang registered an exclusive trademark named CHiKeN, officially opening the period of his fried chicken business.
